Thank you for taking your time to read the Readme.md!

I created a list of variables which overly complicated things because I found myself looping a vairable into another variable on some occassions or a function into a variable. (will not find in repository commits) forgot to create a repository as I was in the process of making this...) I looped "var password= generatePassword;" and I would do "function (generatePassword)" or something along the lines of it. Long story short even I have no idea what I did.... I got most of it sorted out for the most part.

I couldn't quite figure out how to create a function be it with or without boolean. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of running consecutive functions. I tried creating one with the random math generator and I couldn't quite understand the mistake other than the fact that "math was not defined". Would I need to define math? 

Thank you for reading and I hope to give you better results as I make more strives into improving my work down the line. 

P.s learned to make notes in js
